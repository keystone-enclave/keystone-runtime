This is a temporary way to handle files/features from linux that we need.

Files taken from riscv-linux:
arch/riscv/lib/uaccess.S -> uaccess.S
arch/riscv/include/asm/asm.h-> asm/asm.h
arch/riscv/include/asm/csr.h-> asm/csr.h
arch/riscv/include/asm/linkage.h -> asm/linkage.h
include/uapi/linux/const.h -> linux/const.h
include/linux/linkage.h -> linux/linkage.h

Files containing modified linux bits:
partial_linkage.h
uaccess.h
